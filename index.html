      <h2>About Me</h2>

    </p>
    <p>I have a diverse background that mostly revolves around computers. I decided to take up programming because of the current pandemic climate we are in. As everything is moving online, coding will increase my versatility and value in the market place, as well as give me another stream of income </p>
